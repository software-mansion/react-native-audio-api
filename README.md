### React Native Audio API

`react-native-audio-api` provides system for controlling audio in React Native environment compatible with Web Audio API specification,
allowing developers to generate and modify audio in exact same way it is possible in browsers.

## Installation

1. Install `react-native-audio-api` library

   ```bash
   # using npm
   npm install react-native-audio-api

   # or using yarn
   yarn add react-native-audio-api
   ```

## Usage with expo

`react-native-audio-api` contains native custom code and isn't part of the Expo Go application. In order to be available in expo managed builds, you have to use Expo development build. Simplest way on starting local expo dev builds, is to use:

  ```bash
    # Build native iOS project
    npx expo run:ios
    # Build native Android project
    npx expo run:android
  ```

To learn more about expo development builds, please check out [Development Builds Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).
