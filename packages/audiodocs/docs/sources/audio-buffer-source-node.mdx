# AudioBufferSourceNode

The `AudioBufferSourceNode` is an [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node) which represents audio source with in-memory audio data, stored in `AudioBuffer`.
You can use it for audio playback, including standard pause and resume functionalities.

An `AudioBufferSourceNode` can be started only once, so if you want to play the same sound again you have to created new one.
However this node is very inexpensive to create, and what is crucial you can reuse same [`AudioBuffer`](/sources/audio-buffer).

#### [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node#read-only-properties) properties

<AudioNodePropsTable numberOfInputs={0} numberOfOutputs={1} channelCount={"defined by associated buffer"} channelCountMode={"max"} channelInterpretation={"speakers"} />

## Constructor

[`BaseAudioContext.createBufferSource(options)`](/core/base-audio-context#createbuffersource)

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- |
| `buffer` | [`AudioBuffer`](/sources/audio-buffer) | Associated `AudioBuffer`. |
| `detune` | [`AudioParam`](/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` representing detuning of oscillation in cents. |
| `loop` | `boolean` | Boolean indicating if audio data must be replayed after when end of the associated `AudioBuffer` is reached. |
| `loopStart` | `number` | Float value indicating the time, in seconds, at which playback of the audio must begin, if loop is true. |
| `loopEnd` | `number` | Float value indicating the time, in seconds, at which playback of the audio must end and loop back to `loopStart`, if loop is true. |
| `playbackRate` | [`AudioParam`](/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` defining speed factor at which the audio will be played. |

## Methods

### `start` <Overridden />

The above method schedules `AudioBufferSourceNode` to start playback of audio data contained in the associated `AudioBuffer`, or starts to play immediately.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- |
| `when` | `number` | The time, in seconds, at which the node will start to play. |
| `offset` <Optional /> | `number` | An offset, in seconds, determines the starting point for audio playback. |
| `duration` <Optional /> | `number` | The duration, in seconds, of audio playback. |

#### Errors:

| Error type | Description |
| :---: | :---- |
| `RangeError` | `when` is negative number. |
| `RangeError` | `offset` is negative number. |
| `RangeError` | `duration` is negative number. |
| `InvalidStateError` | If node has already been started once. |

#### Returns `undefined`.

## Remarks

#### `buffer`
- If is null, it outputs a single channel of silence (all samples are equal to 0).

#### `detune`
- Default value is 0.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 100 detune the source up by one semitone, whereas -1200 down by one octave.
- When `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range -1200 to 1200.

#### `loop`
- Default value is false.

#### `loopStart`
- Default value is 0.

#### `loopEnd`
- Default value is `buffer.duration`.

#### `playbackRate`
- Default value is 1.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 1.0 plays audio at normal speed, whereas value of 2.0 plays audio twice as fast as normal speed.
- When created with `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range 0 to 3 and uses pitch correction algorithm.
