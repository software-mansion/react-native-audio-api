# RecorderAdapterNode

The `RecorderAdapterNode` is an [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) which is an adapter for [`AudioRecorder`](/inputs/audio-recorder).
It lets you compose audio input from recorder into an audio graph.

## Constructor

[`BaseAudioContext.createRecorderAdapter()`](/core/base-audio-context#createrecorderadapter)

## Example

```tsx
const recorder = new AudioRecorder({
    sampleRate: 48000,
    bufferLengthInSamples: 48000,
});
const audioContext = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 48000 });
const recorderAdapterNode = aCtxRef.current.createRecorderAdapter();

recorder.connect(recorderAdapterNode);
recorderAdapterNode.connect(audioContext.destination)
```

## Remarks
- Adapter without the recorder will produce silence
- Adapter that is connected only to the recorder will work fine and keep small buffer of recorded Data
- Adapter node will not be garbage collected until he is connected to either some destination or recorder
