# Introduction

React Native Audio API is an imperative, high-level API for processing and synthesizing audio in React Native Applications. React Native Audio API follows the [Web Audio Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio-1.1/) making it easier to write audio-heavy applications for iOS, Android and Web with just one codebase.

## Highlights

- Supports react-native, react-native-web or any web react based project
- API strictly follows the Web Audio API standard
- Blazingly fast, all of the Audio API core is written in C++ to deliver the best performance possible
- Truly native, we use most up-to-date native apis such as AVFoundation, CoreAudio or Oboe
- Modular routing architecture to fit simple (and complex) use-cases
- Sample-accurate scheduled sound playback with low-latency for musical applications requiring the highest degree of rhythmic precision.
- Efficient real-time time-domain and frequency-domain analysis / visualization
- Efficient biQuad filters for most common filtering methods.
- Support for computational audio synthesis

## Motivation

By aligning with the Web Audio specification, we're creating a single API that works seamlessly across native iOS, Android, browsers, and even standalone desktop applications. The React Native ecosystem currently lacks a high-performance API for creating audio, adding effects, or controlling basic parameters like volume for each audio separately - and we're here to bridge that gap!


## Alternatives

### Expo Audio

[Expo Audio](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/audio/) might be a better fit for you, if you are looking for simple playback functionality, as its simple and well documented API makes it easy to use.
