# ChannelCountMode

`ChannelCountMode` type determines how the number of input channels affects the number of output channels in an audio node.

**Acceptable values:**
- `max`

  The number of channels is equal to the maximum number of channels of all connections. In this case, `channelCount` is ignored and only up-mixing happens.

 - `clamped-max`

  The number of channels is equal to the maximum number of channels of all connections, clamped to the value of `channelCount`(serves as the maximum permissible value).

- `explicit`

  The number of channels is defined by the value of `channelCount`.
