# AudioNode

The `AudioNode` interface serves as a versatile interface for constructing an audio processing graph, representing individual units of audio processing functionality.
Each `AudioNode` is associated with a certain number of audio channels that facilitate the transfer of audio data through processing graph.

We usually represent the channels with the standard abbreviations detailed in the table below:

| Name | Number of channels | Channels |
| :----: | :------: | :-------- |
| Mono | 1 | 0: M - mono |
| Stereo | 2 | 0: L - left <br /> 1: R - right |
| Quad | 4 | 0: L - left <br /> 1: R - right <br /> 2: SL - surround left <br /> 3: SR - surround right |
| Stereo | 6 | 0: L - left <br /> 1: R - right <br /> 2: C - center <br /> 3: LFE - subwoofer <br /> 4: SL - surround left <br /> 5: SR - surround right |

#### Mixing

When node has more then one input or number of inputs channels differs from output up-mixing or down-mixing must be conducted.
There are three properties involved in mixing process: `channelCount`, [`ChannelCountMode`](/types/channel-count-mode), [`ChannelInterpretation`](/types/channel-interpretation).
Based on them we can obtain output's number of channels and mixing strategy.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- | :-: |
| `context` | [`BaseAudioContext`](/core/base-audio-context) | Associated context. | <ReadOnly /> |
| `numberOfInputs` | `number` | Integer value representing the number of input connections for the node. | <ReadOnly /> |
| `numberOfOutputs` | `number` | Integer value representing the number of output connections for the node. | <ReadOnly /> |
| `channelCount` | `number` | Integer used to determine how many channels are used when up-mixing or down-mixing node's inputs. | <ReadOnly /> |
| `channelCountMode` | [`ChannelCountMode`](/types/channel-count-mode) | Enumerated value that specifies the method by which channels are mixed between the node's inputs and outputs. | <ReadOnly /> |
| `channelInterpretation` | [`ChannelInterpretation`](/types/channel-interpretation) | Enumerated value that specifies how input channels are mapped to output channels when number of them is different. | <ReadOnly /> |

## Methods

### `connect`

The above method lets you connect one of the node's outputs to a destination.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- |
| `destination` | [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) | `AudioNode` to which to connect. |

#### Errors:

| Error type | Description |
| :---: | :---- |
| `InvalidAccessError` | If `destination` is not part of the same audio context as the node. |

#### Returns `undefined`.

### `disconnect`

The above method lets you disconnect one or more nodes from the node.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- |
| `destination` <Optional /> | [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) | `AudioNode` to which to connect. |

If no arguments provided node disconnects from all outgoing connections.

#### Returns `undefined`.

## Remarks

#### `numberOfInputs`
- Source nodes are characterized by having a `numberOfInputs` value of 0.

#### `numberOfOutputs`
- Destination nodes are characterized by having a `numberOfOutputs` value of 0.
